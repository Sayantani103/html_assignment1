4.Write a short note on Tag and element with an example.
Ans-Tag:
In HTML, a tag is a fundamental building block used to define elements within a document. Tags are keywords enclosed in angle brackets (< and >), and they indicate the beginning and end of an element. 

Here's an example of an HTML tag:
<p>
  This is a paragraph element.
</p>

In this example:
<p> is the opening tag, indicating the start of a paragraph element.
</p> is the closing tag, indicating the end of the paragraph element.

Element:
An element is a complete set of tags that define a specific part of an HTML document. It consists of both the opening tag, the closing tag, and the content between them. Elements can be nested inside each other, creating a hierarchical structure.

Here's an example with nested elements:
<div>
  <h2>This is a heading</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div element.</p>
</div>

Inside the <div>, there are two elements: a <h2> heading element and a <p> paragraph element.
